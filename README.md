# 010Editor-keygen
A keygen for 010Editor

## 1. How does the key generated?

  __NOTICE: The content of this section is just my suspection. I cannot guarantee that it is absolutely correct because there is no symbol information in `010Editor.exe` to confirm my suspection.__

  There are 3 types of keys (also called passwords in 010Editor) that can activate 010Editor, which are 

  |Key Type      |Key Length|Format                  |
  |--------------|----------|------------------------|
  |Evaluation    |19 chars  |xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx     |
  |VersionLicense|19 chars  |xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx     |
  |TimeLicense   |24 chars  |xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx|

  The `x` in `Format` column represents a hex char and is case-insensitive if a letter.

  Before I explain each kind of keys, there are some concepts I should give.

  * __Daystamp:__ We know that timestamp is the number of seconds since `00:00:00 Jan. 1st, 1970`. Similarly, daystamp is the number of days since `Jan. 1st, 1970`. For example, the daystamp of `Jan. 2nd, 1970` is __1__ and `Jun. 23th, 2018` is __17705__.

  * __Checksum:__ I'm not sure if it can be called `checksum`. But I do not have a better word to describe it. `Checksum` is a 4-bytes-long data and is related with some parameters. You can go to the definition of function `_010Editor::Keygen<_010Editor::KeyType::Base>::CalculateChecksum` in `_010EditorKeygen.hpp` to see how to calculate it. The function `CalculateChecksum` receives 4 parameters. There are

    |Parameter            |Description                                                        |
    |---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
    |utf8_username        |The UTF-8 bytes of username that the key licensed to.              |
    |IsRegistrationVersion|`false` for `Evaluation` key only. Otherwise it must be `true`.    |
    |a3                   |An unknown parameter. So far it has an unclear meaning.            |
    |LicenseCount         |It represents how many users can use this license. Must be 1~1000. |

  * __EncodedExpireDaystamp__: This is a 3-bytes-long data. The function `_010Editor::Keygen<_010Editor::KeyType::Base>::EncodeExpireDate` in `_010EditorKeygen.hpp` can calulate it. This function receives 2 parameters. There are

    |Parameter           |Description                                              |
    |--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
    |DaystampOfExpiration|The daystamp of expiration. Must be less than 0x1000000. |
    |Seed                |A parameter used in encoding expire daystamp.            |

  * __EncodedLicenseCount__: This is a 2-bytes-long data. The function `_010Editor::Keygen<_010Editor::KeyType::Base>::EncodeLicenseCount` in `_010EditorKeygen.hpp` can calulate it. This function receives only 1 parameter.

    |Parameter          |Description                                          |
    |-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
    |DesiredLicenseCount|The license count your want. Must be Must be 1~1000. |

### 1.1 Evaluation Key

  `Evaluation` key is generated by 8-bytes-long data. To make it clear, I use

  ```cpp
  unsigned char data[8];
  ```

  to represent the 8-bytes-long data.

  `Evaluation` key cannot make your 010Editor become registered version. It can only extend your 010Editor's trial period.

   * __data[4] ~ data[7]__ are __Checksum__ and calculated by `CalculateChecksum` function where `IsRegistrationVersion = false`, `a3 = 255` and `LicenseCount = 1`. `utf8_username` is based on your input.

   * __data[3]__ must be `0xFC`. It represents the type of key.

   * __data[0] ~ data[2]__ are __EncodedExpireDaystamp__ and calculated by `EncodeExpireDate` function where `DaystampOfExpiration` is based on your input and `Seed` is __Checksum__.  

  Finally, the `Evaluation` key is the hex string of `data[8]` where 4 hex chars consist of a block and each block is joined by `"-"`(hyphen). 

### 1.2 VersionLicense Key

  * TODO

### 1.3 TimeLicense Key

  * TODO

## 2. How to build
In console:

```
cd cpp
g++ -std=c++11 main.cpp -o 010Editor-keygen.exe
```

## 3. How to use
Just run it.

Example:
```
E:\Github\010Editor-keygen\cpp>010Editor-keygen.exe
Input your name(English Only): DoubleLabyrinth
47AD-E1AC-D789-D133-2114

E:\Github\010Editor-keygen\cpp>
```

__NOTICE:__  
The key generated will expired after 2020-06-23.
